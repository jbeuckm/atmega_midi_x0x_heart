#### Set MIDI Channel

At startup, the MIDI channel of the device is the same as the device ID set with the trim pot.

A seven-byte sysex message can be used to change the channel of the interface.

`F0 77 33 xx` sysex prefix

`00` select MIDI channel parameter

`xx` new MIDI channel (0 for omni) 

`F7` end of message

#### Patch Dump Request

A six-byte sysex message can be used to request a dump of the current voice parameters.

`F0 77 33 xx` sysex prefix

`01` patch dump request

`F7` end of message

The interface will then send a patch dump sysex message that encodes the current voice parameter values.

`F0 77 33 xx` sysex prefix

`02` patch dump

`ee rr aa pp ss qq dd ff`

envelope, resonance, accent, slide, saw, square, decay, cutoff (eight bytes)

`F7` end of message

This dumped patch data can be used to set all voice parameters by sending it back to the interface.
